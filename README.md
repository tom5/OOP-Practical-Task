OOP-Practical-Task
==================

My solutions to the practical task for the OOP (Object Orientated Programming) lecture course.

In this practical task, I modified the source in the folder originalSrc to produce the code in the folder modifiedSrc. This was done according to the instructions laid out in "OOP-Practical-2-Assignment.pdf". It was also required that I submit a small report detailing what I had done, which I have also included in the file "Final Report.txt".
